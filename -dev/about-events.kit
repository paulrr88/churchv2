                <p>Every fortnight a group called "Dabblers" meets from 2:00 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. on a Thursday to which people bring their favourite hobbies and crafts and do them together. Again, this is a relaxed occasion to which neighbours and friends can easily be invited.</p>
                
                <h2 class="padding-1">Breakfasts</h2>
                
                <p>We are happy to host a Women's Breakfast every three months where women of the village can meet and share fellowship together. A speaker also shares her experience of faith in Jesus. This breakfast is led by a team of women from six churches both in Ferring and the surrounding area.</p>
                
                <p>We also hold a Men's Breakfast regularly, inquire at the church for more details!</p>

                <h1 class="centre padding-1">Women's Fellowship</h1>
                
                <p><strong>This group meets on Tuesdays at 2:30 p.m. during most of the year</strong>. After a relaxing chat over a cup of tea there is a short time of worship followed by a Christian message given by a local speaker.</p>
                
                <p>The quality of the talks and the warmth of fellowship are usually very special. <strong>Particular events at certain times of year (such as the visit of children from the local school to sing carols at Christmas) are very much enjoyed</strong>. In summer months when weather permits some members open their gardens for the meeting to take place outdoors. </p>
