                        <p>Welcome to the FBC website! Our life at Ferring Baptist Church is founded on the scriptures and the 
                            saving work of Jesus Christ, and our aim is to make Jesus 
                            and his love the focus of everything we do. Our worship 
                            blends older and newer styles in a way that seeks to be 
                            encouraging, positive, and accessible to people of 
                            different traditions and backgrounds. The 10:30 A.M. 
                            service is definitely the larger of the two, with the 
                            6:30 P.M. worship attractive to some because of its more 
                            intimate atmosphere.</p>

                        <p>Situated in Greystoke Road, we are just round the corner 
                            from Church Lane and St. Andrew's C. of E. with whom 
                            we work closely as we seek to represent Christ in Ferring.</p>
