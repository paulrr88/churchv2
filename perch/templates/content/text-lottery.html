<div id="lottery<perch:content type="select" id="lotteryid" label="Hide lottery logo" options=" invisible" help="Set to invisible to hide the lottery logo" allowempty="true" />"></div><perch:help>
<p>This is just for the funded by lottery logo at the top of the webpage for use in 2017-18, so that you can make it invisible once it's no longer needed. Once it's turned off you shouldn't need to tinker with this item again!</p>
